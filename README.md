<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Plan for creating this project was realised. It contains only front-end part of e-commerce site, to simmulate full functionallity of a real store. Focus was mostly on high accessiblity, according to lighthouse raport it is 100% on mobile and desktop. It is possible to navigate only with keyboard, and by using screen reader.
I think the whole design part could be better if it was planned previously (for example If I created mockup's in figma). But it was created on the fly, and wasn't my main focus. 
My main focus was to learn React useContext hook, react Router, train components in more complex structure than in my previous React projects, learn Styled-components (by the way my opinion on that: it is a very comfort way for writting style, but what concern me is am I using it according to best practices, a lot of styling is repeating).
